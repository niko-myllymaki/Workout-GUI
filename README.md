# **Workout-log-GUI**

A GUI program made with javax.swing libraries to log and read workout sessions to and from a xml-file.

As shown in the screenshots, this program allows for user to log what kind of workout they've had on that day (Push, Pull, Leg), the *Date* of the workout, *Add* the exercises done on that day (more exercises can be added after adding the first one, but before submiting the workout) and finally *Submit* the workout to an xml-file, the contents of which can be read by the *Read* button. The *Clear* button will delete the whole file, the user will be prompted if they are sure to delete the file. The contents of the xml-file will persist even after the user exits the program.
